## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a secret project (I will probably never finish it tho)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning various things in Kyung Hee University in Korea
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Discord mainly. @VaVaLeVal
- âš¡ Fun fact: 99% of the time, when someone say fun fact, they are just about to say a fact that is just a fact. That wasn't fun either.
- ğŸ¥– Fact: I'm French.
